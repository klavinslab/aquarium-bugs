## Feature request

<!-- Write your feature as a user-story by replacing user-type, task and goal -->

**User story:** As a *researcher*, I want Aquarium to *email* me my sequencing results so that I know to *take action in my plan* (tell Aquarium how my results look).

I'm telling people to check their plans periodically in my video, but this would be a really helpful reminder.
