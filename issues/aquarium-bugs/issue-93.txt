Can we just get rid of any time a user has to see "check plate" and "upload sequencing results?" All plates should be checked and all sequencing results should be uploaded. I feel like this is just adding a lot of confusion and makes plans needlessly more complicated. I am sure there are other places where this is also true.

Would be resolved by having hierarchical plans.
