#215 As a  researcher/manager, I want to be able to delete items that have been created in operations submitted by me even if the strain was created by another person.

See plan 3342, operation 16462. User Joe Control created a bunch of items through operations but can't discard them because the samples are owned by David Younger. This comes down to the fact that items don't really have ownership -- only samples do.

Admins can now delete anyone's items with the Discard List of Items operation, but your mentioned wrinkle still remains.
