It would be convenient if there were additional tabs in the developer called 'SHOWS' and 'MODEL'. SHOWS would be a place to put all the show blocks, and MODEL would be a place to put all the hairy logic. They would be imported into the protocol tab automatically. This would make the PROTOCOL tab a lot cleaner and easier to read.
