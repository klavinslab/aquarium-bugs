#272 feature request: upload button remain "live" until used
By segoldberg on 2017-12-04 22:10:49 UTC

## Feature request
As a technician, I want the upload button to be "live" even if I skipped over it (by mistake, or to read the next few protocol steps). It would be better if it turned gray only after it was used for uploading.

Hi! Could you provide more information on which upload button? A screenshot would be great. Thanks!

THE PROBLEM: for a show block containing the "upload" command, if you press
the green ok (or right arrow) before uploading, the upload button is no
longer active.
THE REQUESTED FEATURE: keep the upload button live as long as nothing has
been uploaded, or if the technician goes back to that step.

i do not have screenshots.
any code containing the "upload" command. example:

uploads = show do
                title "Select a file"
                upload var: "uploaded_file"
end

for testing, you can use the highlighted protocol (on production, make your
own copy) to request and up load to existing items/plans.
