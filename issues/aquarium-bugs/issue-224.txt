- **Reproduce by:** creating a module with one input linked to two different operations, e.g., link the input of module "Yeast QC" (which i saved as a system-wide template) to two "Yeast Lysate" operations and then input a sample id
- **Expected:** the sample should propagate into both yeast lysate operations
- **Actual:** it doesn't -- one set of protocols is filled out, but the other isn't 
- **Acceptance criteria:** when everything is filled out correctly, i.e., the inputs/outputs of all the operations within the module have been filled out with the correct sample ids

Ok, I have added this as a special case of propagation. Hopefully I didn't break anything in the process. The fix gets right into the heart of the propagation code.

awesome! i'll test it out and let you know if it works.

i'm still having this issue. inside the module, this is in the left set of protocols: 
![yeast_lysate_one](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17604778/30568746-cc3d2952-9c8b-11e7-84d0-9efdc95a5a4d.png)
and this is in the right set of protocols: 
![lysate_2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17604778/30568784-055da626-9c8c-11e7-9995-293b856572e8.png)

the input for the entire module is sample id 16666

I am not sure I know what you mean by left and right set of protocols. Can you just save a plan your "Your Plans" and tell me which one it is and how to break it?

Is this still a problem?
