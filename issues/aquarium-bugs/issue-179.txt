IWBNI there was a button to download a properly formatted csv template for each sample type. The manual entry is pretty error prone and I believe that we should make it as easy as possible for users to upload using csv.

If I'm understanding, this has two parts:
- a template for users to complete
- an ability for users to upload the completed template

Is that correct?

The second is already implemented. As a user, it not obvious what a properly-formatted file looks like.
