I'm trying to update the location of a plate from the 30 degree incubator to a real empty location in the DFP. I looked up an empty slot and tried to update using that slot, but it keeps telling me that I can't use that location because 30249 is in that location. (30249 was deleted in 2015). I tried a few more empty locations (according to the inventory) and got the same result with the same plate 30249 being in that spot.
