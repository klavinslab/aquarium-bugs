I'm not sure if this counts as a major issue or not, because it has a fairly simple workaround and we don't have any module templates yet that are severely hurt by the glitch.
 
When a user selects inputs for a operation with variable input item type, they are able to select which object/sample combination that they will use as an input item using the pink checkboxes, like for the integrant in Plasmid Digest + Yeast Transformation shown below:

However, if this same operation is contained inside of a module, the user can no longer specify what item type to choose for that input without going into the module and changing the item type of the operation-input that the module-input wires to.
(the checkboxes do not show the selected item type nor do they respond to clicking)

This issue affects inputs and outputs of modules the same.
