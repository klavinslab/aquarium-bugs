#284 Bug in planner: Connecting wires does not propagate inputs/outputs in planner
By emernic on 2018-02-28 17:20:44 UTC

## Bug report

- **Reproduce by:** 
Create a plan, add two operations, specify inputs for one operation, connect the two operations.
- **Expected:** Inputs/outputs are propagated through to the other operation based on routing.
- **Actual:** Inputs/outputs are not propagated, and the i/o for the second operation remains blank (and circles remain orange). However, retyping the sample name for the first operation **will** cause samples to propagate along wires based on routing.
- **Acceptance criteria:** Wiring two operations together causes inputs/outputs to propagate along wires based on routing.
