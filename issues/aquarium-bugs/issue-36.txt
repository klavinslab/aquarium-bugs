It would be nice to have the precondition errors show up in the testing of the developer. Currently we only get:
```
Error
One or more preconditions could not be evaluated.
```
Which makes it difficult to debug the code.

You also get a debug message as a data association in the plan or the operation, I believe. Does that help?
