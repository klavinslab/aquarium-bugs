## Bug report

Subsequent operations are not firing after replanning a series of operations (as in replanning an entire module).

- **Reproduce by:** Replanning a series of errored out protocols. For example above, the Make PCR Fragment module had the wrong fragment. I replanned the entire module. Make PCR fragment was run successfully, but Run Gel is stuck in waiting. The input to Run Gel to not the same item as the output of the Make PCR fragment and still refers to the deleted item from the previously errored run.
- **Expected:** Subsequent operations are run after replanning
