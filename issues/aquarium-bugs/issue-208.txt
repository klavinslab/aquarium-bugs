When I use Ctrl-A on the planner, it selects all the operations in the plan, but it also highlights all the text on screen. 
Likewise when I use Ctrl-S on the planner, the plan is saved, but it also opens up a popup window to save the html file of the planner page to my computer.

Ok, fixed this for ctrl-A and ctrl-S. I also removed the ctrl-N shortcut because apparently you can't capture it on windows. Finally, it is still an issue that the shortcuts only work when the main editor is the focus.
