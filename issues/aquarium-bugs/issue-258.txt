## Bug report

array inputs don't work as expected if the plan with the array input operation has been already been saved. If an array input operation is in a saved plan, it becomes impossible to increase the amount of inputs for that array input operation.

- **Reproduce by:** *Make new plan, place operation with single array input, save. Then add an array input and save again*
- **Expected:** *The operation has 2 inputs*.
- **Actual:** *The operation has 1 input*
- **Acceptance criteria:** *you can save plans with array inputs and then later add elements to their input array*
