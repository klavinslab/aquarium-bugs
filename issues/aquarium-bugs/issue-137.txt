This has been brought up before, but I don't seem to see it in the issues.

The protocol carousel gradually shifts as you progress through a protocol, forcing the technician to refresh the page eventually.

This is particularly annoying for my protocols since the technician is using a projector and foot pedal and _cannot_ leave the biosafety cabinet during the middle of a protocol to click refresh.

You can see the "OK" from the previous step creeping up in the following image.
