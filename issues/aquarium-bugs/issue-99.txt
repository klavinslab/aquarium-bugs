If you open the 'Cloning > Rehydrate Primer' protocol, then click on the 'Yeast Display' category in the sidebar, you get this:

which is incorrect because there is no 'Reydrate Primer' within 'Yeast 'Display' category.

I've been thinking about this in the context of my possible observation last week that protocol DEF forms were saving to the wrong record. Because this was such a fleeting thing and I can't verify or reproduce it, and also because it is a very unlikely mode of failure in vanilla rails forms, I was skeptical that it is actually happening.

However, thinking about it in the context of javascript, it seems more likely. Depending on how the javascript is implemented, it could produce this mode of failure.

If the application produces all possible forms, then the javascript hides all but one, then it is still unlikely that this failure would happen. 

However, if the javascript manipulates the record id in the HTML tags directly, then it could lead to exactly this behavior if one navigation click updates the id, but a subsequent click fails to update it. In my admittedly limited experience, these kinds of silent, history-dependent failures are the most annoying thing about javascript.
