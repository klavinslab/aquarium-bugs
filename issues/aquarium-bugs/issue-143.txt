Since the rehydrate primer protocol takes a lyophilized primer and makes a stock and an aliquot, it seems as though there is no way to just make a new aliquot from a stock when an aliquot runs out. I am trying to submit a sequencing plan and I can't use one of my primers because of this and will have to manually make an aliquot in order to submit the plan. The same problem would come up for PCRs.

"Make Primer Aliquot from Stock" operation is up and running. Give it a try!
