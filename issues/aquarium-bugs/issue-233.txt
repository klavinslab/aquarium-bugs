#233 As a user, I would like to reply to the Sequencing ok? in my plans with a drop-down menu so that it is less confusing as to what to say.

As a user, the sequencing ok field ? is quite confusing. It seems like it should be a pull-down menu. Also, the icons that are used to save or revert (?) are not intuitive. It would be nice if they were more conventional and had some explanations upon mouseover. I've found https://material.io/icons (e.g. https://material.io/icons/#ic_save) to be a very useful library.
