#285 Bug: Object type not updating when propagating inputs/outputs in planner
By emernic on 2018-03-02 01:17:56 UTC

## Bug report

<!-- Give affected user and basic description in issue title -->

- **Reproduce by:** Create a plan using an operation with multiple possible output object types. Connect a downstream operation, and enter a sample on the downstream operation which has items of the wrong object type for the upstream operation.
- **Expected:** Upstream operation (the one with multiple possible output object types) has its object type changed to match the sample type and object type of the downstream operation.
- **Actual:** Object type of upstream operation does not change. Node shows up green, but there are actually no items of the selected object type and sample.
