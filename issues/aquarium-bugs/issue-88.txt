See [this plan](http://52.27.43.242:81/launcher?plan_id=25369). I am able to submit Send to Sequencing (an On the Fly operation) without satisfying its inputs. I don't have a primer aliquot for the primer I specified.

Additionally, I can't select my Unverified Plasmid Stock for the plasmid input to the operation. It looks like the planner doesn't check existing items to satisfy On the Fly operation inputs.
