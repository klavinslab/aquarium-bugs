If you try to edit a container for an existing sample or create a new container, it will default the sample type to Primer.

For example, if you edit a Fragment Stock container, the sample type will change to Primer. If you miss this, the container will change sample types.

With all of the new workflows coming online and the changes to existing workflows, I think this is fairly important to fix before someone unknowingly starts swapping sample types of item containers, especially those in production.

I second this. This bug has bested me a couple times before.
