**User story:** As a *researcher*, it would be nice to have a button to launch a Direct Purchase job on the front page of Aquarium so that I don't have to fill out the weekly supplies spreadsheet.

**Also:** As a *lab manager*, this would be nice so that I don't have to maintain a weekly supplies spreadsheet.

This issue is pretty orthogonal to the Graphical Planner epic, so I'm removing that association. I imagine this would be a button on the Aquarium homepage and/or banner for the user to click. This is the only OperationType I can think of where the user should be able to run the job themselves.
