Currently, all object types in each element in an input array are always same in the planner.

For example:
   I may want to submit a golden gate with:
      Backbone (a Plasmid Stock)
      Insert 1 (a Plasmid Stock)
      Insert 2 (a Fragment Stock)
      Insert 3 (an Unverified Plasmid Stock)

   For transfections, I often want things like this to be submitted:
      Plasmid 1 (a Plasmid Stock)
      Plasmid 2 (a Maxiprep Stock)
      Plasmid 3 (a Midiprep Stock
      Plasmid 4 (an Unverifed Plasmid Stock)
