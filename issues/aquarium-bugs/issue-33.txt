This would be nice for collaborating (particularly with someone working on the same project or with an undergrad assistant).

Though, would we want limited permissions for this? Maybe a user can specify which other users can view their plans in their account preferences?

Yeah, we could use groups. People also want to limit who can see their samples, so that could serve the same purpose.
