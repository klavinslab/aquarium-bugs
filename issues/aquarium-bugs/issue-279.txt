## Feature request

<!-- Write your feature as a user-story by replacing user-type, task and goal -->

**User story:** As a *protocol developer*, it would be convenient to be able to access a list of object types for array inputs using **op.input_array("Input Name").object_types**. This would maintain consistency with the other array input methods (which closely match the methods available for normal inputs except for the absence of an object_types method).
