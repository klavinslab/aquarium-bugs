This is the unfinished portion of #193

Protocol developers may need to use both nursery and production servers for a number of reasons, but need a server-specific version of the XSRF-TOKEN cookie. 

I'm closing #193 and putting this in icebox for next round.

We now have another problem, which is that if I have BIORAF/Manager open while using Nursery, then when BIOFAB/Manager auto updates, it messes with some cookie somewhere logging me out of Nursery. In fact, I keep having to log back into Nursery and it is not clear why. The cookies should not expire that fast.
