#181 As a workflow developer, I want the selected developer tab to persist between protocols so that I do not have to reselect the tab

When switching between protocols, keep the current tab rather than default back to the Def tab. This way a developer can leaf through to quickly compare the code, pre, or cost of multiple protocols.
