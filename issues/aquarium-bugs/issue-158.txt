When there is an antibiotic plate required for a yeast transformation an overnight is made, but there's no protocol where the actual antibiotic plate gets made.

Protocol now exists, but in order for it to be useful to the yeast workflow, Plasmid Digest+Yeast transform may need to be split into two separate protocols. Yeast transform could then have a prereq that waits until the required antibiotic plates are available
