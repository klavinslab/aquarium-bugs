The x button next to templates intuitively seems to just be for deleting a template, but what it actually does is simultaneously delete the template and open the just deleted template as a newly saved plan. This functionality works great for removing a faulty template from the list, editing it as a plan, and then making it a template again, but it can have problems for an unaware user attempting to edit their template.

With an existing faulty plan that I wanted to edit, here are the intuitive steps I took to achieve loss of work:

- add faulty template to my plan

- modify template till it is perfect and fixed

- now I use x button to delete the old faulty template from template list because I now have a better version in my planner that I am about to add to the list

- the x button pulls the faulty template into a new plan, and my current unsaved plan which contained my modified template disappears forever

Perhaps I am not the brightest bulb... but I did the above steps multiple times while editing templates before I understood what the button actually did

<hr>
I see a couple ways that the interface can be improved for template editing:


Make the x button *only* remove the template from the list
Or
Keep the "revert to plan" functionality, but just add the template to saved plans without getting rid of current unsaved work
And/Or
Make it more clear what the button is doing by adding a more detailed tooltip and changing it from an x to a down arrow.

Oh I guess the main Issue is that usually when you are about to change plans there is a popup which asks you to save first: not so with the x button next to templates

Ok, changed the behavior of this so that there is a dialog and so that it doesn't replace the current plan.
