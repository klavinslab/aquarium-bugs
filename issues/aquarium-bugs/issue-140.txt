#140 As a Protocol Developer I would like to have a convention for routing with input/output arrays to avoid illegal combinations and complicated definition of outputs

There is currently no convention for input/output array routing. I would like some convention for disallowing the following input (where multiple Lentivirus Harvests are combined into a single bigger harvest). In this case, two different Lentiviruses ("GFP LV" and "Citrine LV") are combined into another type, which shouldn't happen.

This would also be nice for output array, in which you want the outputs to all be the sample sample without having to click and type each sample.
