## bug

- **Operation name:** *Extract Gel*
- **Expected:** *input item shows the row column location of the fragment next to the item id with 1-based indexing*
- **Actual:** *input item shows the row column location of the fragment next to the item id with 0-based indexing, while the gel image plan association uses 1-based indexing. Contradictory, and confusing for users who don't understand 0-based indexing*
