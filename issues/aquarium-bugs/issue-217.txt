It would be nice to make it easier to add non sample items into the inventory. 


If lab managers keep track of the locations of lab equipment items in the inventory, then, instead of hard coding in the string location of a tool into a protocol, a user can be told to retrieve: Item.find_by_object_type_id( ObjectType.find_by_name("Tweezers")).location

This way, protocols can be more portable to other labs with different equipment locations
