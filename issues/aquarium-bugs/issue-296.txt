#296 (Production) Fragment Analyzer false nil report on field value
By jonluntzel on 2018-05-22 18:20:11 UTC

## Protocol bug

<!-- Give operation name and basic description in issue title -->
<!-- Fragment Analyzing - under Yeast New in Production, gathers fragment stripwells and organizes
them in the fragment analyzer machine before uploading results to Aquarium -->

- **Operation name:** *Fragment Analyzing*
- **Expected:** *gather fragment stripwells, organize them in the fragment analyzer, upload results to Aquarium*
- **Actual:** *error: undefined method `value' for nil:NilClass*
- **Link:** *http://52.27.43.242/krill/log?job=65461*


## Bug report

<!-- Samer/Cami - protocol aborted, even though it had been working for a while -->

- **Reproduce by:** *Aquire a (Yeast Strain) sample and print its "Has this strain passed QC?" field value*
- **Expected:** *Prints yes / no*.
- **Actual:** *is a nil value, despite  the sample having the field in Aquarium database*
- **Acceptance criteria:** *Field value prints what the sample internally has: yes or no*

- Abe found that editing and saving a sample fixed its output, so it may be possible to fix just by running a script that edits and saves the samples with the "Has this strain passed QC?" field value without actually modifying them.
