As a BIOFAB user, it would be nice if I could use GeneWiz's universal sequencing primers instead of having to use a primer that we have ordered and already have in the lab:

Note that the primer doesn't have to be included in the sample that we send them. They add it.

Actually, it appears that you can do this if you use e.g. primer 19086? Is that correct?
