In some cases, an operation may have multiple options for input and output containers. Sometimes, I think we would like the ability to link input and output container selections in a similar way that sample routing currently works.

For example, in my "Trypsinize Plate" workflow, the inputs can be one of four possible containers which transform a Plate container to a Trypsinized Plate container. Some valid transitions would be
"T25" > "Trypsinized T25"
"T75" > "Trypsinized T75"
While invalid transitions would be
"T25" X "Trypsinized T175" (This makes no sense since it changes the plate size).

It would be nice if output containers also had some routing functionality such that when you select a input container, the output container type would automatically switch to the container indicated by the routing id.
