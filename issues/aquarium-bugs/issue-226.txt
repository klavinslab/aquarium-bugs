#226 Nursery sign-in page doesn't work

I am unable to access the sign in page for nursery. Is this just me? Possibly caused by the fix for the cookie issue #193

Here's that error message:

It could be either one.

Looks like I messed up an injector. 

Changing the html tag of `aq2.html.erb` to 
```
<html ng-app='aquarium' ng-controller='layoutCtrl' ng-cloak style="overflow: hidden" ng-strict-di>
```
causes this to happen on local.

 The problem was in the injector for the onbeforeunload handler.  The current version of master resolves this, but I'm having an issue with already having a new library in the db.  I'm not sure if this Is a real problem or not.

Ben, The reason this doesn't work on nursery is because nursery uglifies the js. So you can't do

  w.controller('codeCtrl', function (  $scope,   $http,   $attrs,   $cookies ) {
     ...
  });


but have to do

  w.controller('codeCtrl', [ '$scope', '$http', '$attrs', '$cookies', 
                  function (  $scope,   $http,   $attrs,   $cookies ) {
    ...
  }]);

Ah. I see you fixed it on master. I have pushed this code to nursery and am able to log in.

What is this issue "having a new library in the db"?

A library with the default name is already in the database, and so creating
a new library fails.

@Gamemackerel if this is working, please move it to done.
