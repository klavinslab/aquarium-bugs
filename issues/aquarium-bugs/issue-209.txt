#209 minor Planner GUI glitch: when a plan that contains a module is collapsed into a module, some wires are removed

If I have a plan with module like this:
![module in plan](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3107677/30399275-fc7cc77e-9887-11e7-8b0a-741b0dcb828c.PNG)

And I decide to make a new module that contains that entire plan
![containingmodule](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3107677/30399296-0edf6fde-9888-11e7-8e94-61b05cded8c3.PNG)

upon expanding the containing module, I discover all the wires to and from the intermediate module are removed.

The wires can be re-established without too much effort, but could be troublesome when making huge overarching modules with detailed internal organization. 

creating an empty module and then building modules up from scratch avoids this issue entirely, its only the 'instant module from selection' feature that causes it.

Ok, this is fixed.
