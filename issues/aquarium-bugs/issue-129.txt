Sample type definitions can have an array of samples as a field. However, in the planner, autofilling sample inputs for arrays is not yet supported. Currently, the planner will autofill only last sample in the field array of the sample type definition. I think the desired functionality would be that it automatically creates an input array for the operation of equal size as the array defined in the sample definition.

This pops up in a few cases in the mammalian cell workflow:
- In transfections, where a Cell Line has an array of transfected plasmids in the sample definition as an array
- Tissue Culture Media bottle where "Reagents" are defined in the sample definition of the "Tissue Culture Media" as an sample array
