JSON inputs in the planner gets trimmed to 255 characters after saving. You are allowed to enter large JSON but it automatically trims after saving. A 255 character JSON is not very large. We may want to interpret very large JSON files for some protocols.

Set to **CRITICIAL** since this is limiting some customers from submitting Order gBlock Fragment operations. The Order gBlock Fragment uses a JSON input field to interpret sequences. I was using a JSON input since I assumed the JSON input field was very large.

Ok, but I think people should order gblocks by linking sequences to their Fragment descriptions.
