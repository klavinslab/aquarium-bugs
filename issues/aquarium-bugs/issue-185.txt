#185 job.rb
By dvnstrcklnd on 2017-09-06 21:42:14 UTC

```ruby
has_many :job_associations
  # has_many :operations, through: :jobs_associations # not working for some reason
  def operations
    job_associations.collect { |ja| ja.operation }
  end
```

I happened to notice this while looking at the code. I think the reason why this is not working is that it should be `:job_associations` not `:jobs_associations`
