#62 It would be helpful to be able to "compare" previous versions of protocols (a la Git diff)

This would be essentially the same as the Git diff. This would include a few key features
- Line numbers for current version and previous version
- Lines removed and lines added from previous to current version
- Author of the previous version (#31)

I've been grappling with myself about whether to suggest moving our protocols to GitHub because I'm wary of us reinventing the wheel with our own version control scheme. Still, I think this feature is necessary, especially as we increase the size of the dev team.

I believe this is the main version control feature we're missing that Git would provide us.
