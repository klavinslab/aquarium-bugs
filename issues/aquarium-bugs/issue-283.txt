**User story:** As an *end user*, adding samples is one of the main hurdles to using Aquarium. After designing my cloning workflow in other software such as Benchling or SnapGene, I must manually create a properly formatted excel file with the relevant information. It would be easier if I could bulk upload a list of Genbank files and have Aquarium automatically extract the relevant information. A roadblock to implementing this would be that sample types are currently instance-specific.
