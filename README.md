# Aquarium Issues

This repository is used to manage the issues for the Aquarium software used in the [UW Biofab](http://www.uwbiofab.org).


Issues reported here should include
- protocol bugs,
- (Aquarium) bugs, or
- feature requests.

If you want a new protocol, please talk with a BIOFAB lab manager.
When writing an issue, edit the template to include only the relevant part for the type of issue.


For Aquarium bugs and feature requests, reports should identify the affected users.
Possibilities include *Researchers*, *Lab Managers*, *Technicians*, *Protocol Developers*, and *Administrators*.


For feature requests, we want to use user stories to describe new features.
A *user-story* is a way that software behavior is described at a high level from the user perspective.
Each user story is a statement of *who* is affected, *what* task or action they want to be able to do, and *why* they want to do it.
An example user story is
> As a Lab Manager, I need to assign a job to a Technician so that the job is completed.

or
> As a Protocol Developer, I need to be able to save my editor preferences so that I don't need to change them each time I start an editing session.

Each story represents a [conversation](http://ronjeffries.com/xprog/articles/expcardconversationconfirmation/) that needs to occur, so do your best to adhere to the form while expecting that we will ask for more detail.


Feel free to modify the templates and make a pull-request so that we can review changes.


Please be sure to adhere to the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
